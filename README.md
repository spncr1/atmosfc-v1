# Atmos FC

Atmos FC analyses fan sentiment and online reaction around football matches by collecting YouTube comments from match highlight videos and turning them into a readable post-match snapshot. 

Users can search for finished fixtures, filter by competition and season, pick a match, and see how the mood shifted in the 24 hours after full time through a reaction intensity chart, top comments, match events, overall vibe labels, and crowd energy indicators. 

The aim is to turn thousands of scattered reactions into one centralised view of what a match felt like after the final whistle.

## The problem

Following football in the modern era can feel more emotionally taxing than ever, especially when more and more high-profile matches are creating multitudes of highlight reels, reaction clips, posts, replies, and comment sections across the many social media platforms people have access to. 

If a fan cannot watch the match live, whether because it is on late at night, they missed the broadcast, or they could not get to the game, it can be hard to get a proper feel for what actually happened without scrolling through thousands of comments online, all saying different things. 

Atmos FC is built to make that post-match catch-up easier for the average fan by bringing that reaction into one place, starting with YouTube comments, so users can quickly understand whether the game was exciting, disappointing, controversial, quiet, or genuinely memorable. By using VADER sentiment analysis and time-based comment bucketing in Python, the app focuses on the first 24 hours after full time, when the raw fan reaction is typically strongest.

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Python, FastAPI, API-Football, Neon Postgres, Football-Data.org, YouTube Data API, VADER
- Frontend: vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js
- Backend deployment: Railway
- Frontend deployment: Vercel

## Running the Project locally

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spncr1/atmosfc-v1.git
cd atmosfc-v1
```

Install the frontend tooling:

```bash
npm install
```

Create a backend virtual environment and install the Python dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

Create `backend/.env` with the API keys required by the FastAPI service:

```bash
FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY=your_football_data_api_key_goes_here
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_api_football_key_goes_here
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_pooled_connection_string
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL=your_neon_direct_connection_string
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_goes_here
CORS_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open the local frontend URL shown in the terminal.

## Deployment

The frontend reads its backend URL from `frontend/js/config.js` in production. After deploying the FastAPI backend, set `ATMOS_CONFIG.API_BASE` to that public backend URL and redeploy the frontend.

The Railway backend must have these environment variables:

```bash
API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_api_football_key_goes_here
DATABASE_URL=your_neon_pooled_connection_string
DIRECT_DATABASE_URL=your_neon_direct_connection_string
FOOTBALL_DATA_API_KEY=your_football_data_api_key_goes_here
YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_youtube_api_key_goes_here
CORS_ORIGINS=https://atmosfc-v1.vercel.app,http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
```

Railway runs the database migrations on startup before launching FastAPI.
